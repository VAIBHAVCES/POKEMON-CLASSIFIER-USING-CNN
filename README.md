# POKEMON-CLASSIFIER-USING-CNN
I have  used concepts of convolutional neural network to classify this dataset of pokemon images which has mainly three pokemons in its training dataset and prediction dataset

## What's the problem
Here problem was to create a model for classifying pokemons as **Pikachu , Bulbasaur , Charmander** now in our "Images" path i have some images on which we have to train our data , and in "Images" folder inside "test dataset" folder should be used to predict . We have specified csv files which can be used  for training and by inspiring from that in the same format result is  needed to be predicted.

## My approach""
By different hyperparametric approach and different values I found CNN most reliable for this purpouse . I have used around 100 epochs to gain the required acccuracy and this was max i can get with least no of layers possible , I have taken down iteration time from 21secs to 11-13sec , improved training and validation accuracy

## Result
Attained training accuracy of around **83 % and validation accuracy of around 86% and reduced epoch iteration time by around 10sec each**



**PLEASE GIVE YOUR FEEDBACK , WHERE I AM WRONG , HOW CAN I MORE IMPROVE IT**

**YOUR COMMIT WILL BE TRUELY APPRECIABLE**
